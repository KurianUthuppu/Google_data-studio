### Loading data source with data via connectors
- Go to data sources tab and then click 'Create data source'
- Connect to requisite data via various connectors including google excel, analytics and big-query
- Alternatively, to export data from big-query, you can use the 'Export with Data-studio' option under export that is available when you click a particular data-table

### Creating Reports
- Once the data-source is connected via the requisite connector, one could see the various column headers under dimensions
- One can create additional dimensions/columns using 'Add a field' option; this could be calculated field based on the loaded dimension (more on this later)
- You may add a paramater if values have to be accepted from the customer which would reflect on the data-visualization dashboards
- Once you are satisfied with dimensions and its types, you can create a report using 'Create report' option on the top-right corner

### Building dashboards
- You can easily create the requisite dashboards using various charts and inserting various controls
- The important part is to be clear on what exactly you are trying to value-add to the user in terms of extracting information/insights from data
- This will lead to how exactly the data visualization to be done, using which dashboards or controls
- Once the mental design is clear, it's about creating the dashboards which is sort of relatively easy
- You can create new fields or add new parameters (to accept real-time user inputs) as well
- Final steps may require some trail & error as things may not have come exactly as you had envisioned
